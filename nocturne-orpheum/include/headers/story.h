Welcome to the world.\n\nYou start as a human with all your stats set to 1, HP at 10, but as time goes on, you can level up your stats, learn skills, collect weapons, and find gear.\n\nGear and weapons can also have their own buffs and skills as you get further in the game.\n\nHere, take this [BASIC DULL SWORD], [CHIPPED HELMET], and [REVIVAL STONE] (press p to pick up).\n",

  "Alright, looks like you know the controls. Now, welcome to Zandris. You may have lost your memory after the collapse of Orpheum, so allow me to clue you in.\nThe sky you see above you is actually the ocean K'ver, and those stars are living leviathans. They've been docile until now, so we don't know what their intentions are, but at least they give us light.\nMost people, including you, have been corrupted by the side effects of magic and Orpheum collapsing. You, however, are special, patient 0. You can earn your memories back. However, it won't be easy. To start with, give this voice in your head a name, will you?\n",

  "Firstly, here's something cool. Let's go back about a few hours, shall we?\n", // If you look in ../extra/lore.txt, you'll see that a cutscene is mentioned at the beginning. Since I'm limited by this text based game, I'm just typing it out.
  "Hmm, let's see here...\nTo start Project Orpheum, which was being developed in this very lab... if you can still call it that, was an attempt to link this world to a higher dimension using magic, and it worked. There were, however, adverse effects.\nIf you look above you, the leviathans that once lit up our world no longer have their light.\nThat's just one effect of the bridge between the 2 worlds. The major effect is... UNAUTHORIZED. REVERTING STATE.\n"
