World Structure
- 9 landmasses float around, caged from the cosmos in a vast, all-encompassing ocean that makes the sky above our people’s heads
- The stars, living leviathans made of light and flesh swim in the ocean k’ver
- After the Orpheum is created, the leviathans die, falling to the depths. All light is lost, save for The Pale Pillars (columns of light stretching from the bottom to the top of the oceans symptoms of the breach of the curse of the gods)

History
