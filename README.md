# Zandris
Made a console based RPG game. Still very basic, started on 1/29/25
Please contribute if you'd like! Any help is appreciated. Need help thinking of a good storyline :P

## Dependencies  
    
    GNU Make  
    G++ (Linux), Clang++ (Mac), or MinGW (Windows) as a C++ compiler, >= 14
Note: Precompiled binaries WILL be in the repo, so no need to install the dependencies if you're going to use that  
    
## How to play:
#### Download the ZIP file from github & extract it's contents
#### Open terminal and use cd to navigate to the directory. For example, if extracted in Downloads:
     Mac & Linux: ``cd ~/Downloads/Zandris/nocturne-orpheum``  
     Windows: ``cd C:\Users\[your username]\Downloads\Zandris\nocturne-orpheum``
#### Compile the game with ``make`` in the directory after downloading and extracting the ZIP file.
#### Run ``./game`` to start the game (runs in terminal)
#### Follow the instructions in the game, and have fun!

### Todo:
    1) Implement save files (.zave, get it? Because like... Zandris sAVE... I'll see myself out)
    2) Merge new story with src/main.cpp
    3) Add graphics (OpenGL or SFML)
    4) Add quests (./headers/quest.h)

### Known bugs: None (just fixed issue where pick didn't erase from ground, stupid mistake lmao)
